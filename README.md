    This script helps to keep track of

Issue This Project Helps To Solve:
    Rather than researching each stock at a time to see whether the stock price has reached your desired price to buy in. This script helps you to automate that.

How To Run The Script:
1. Clone the repository down to your local computer
2. Change the User-agent that's in the stockInfoRequest function (in the getStockPrices.py file) to your own computer:
    You can find this information by googling "User-Agent"
    Copy and past the result to the inside the stockInfoRequest function
3. Add the company stocks that you're interested in investing in to the stockWatchList.py file
    Use the samples that are in the files to format the stocks
    Set the price that you want the stock to drop to so that you invest in it
        To get a target entry price, you can simply research a company's all-time high stock price, then calculate a percent
4. Save the files and then Run the getStockPrices.py file in the command line using following:
        python3 getStockPrices.py
5. If everything ran sucessfully:
    You will see a new csv file in the folder that has the results:
